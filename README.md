My custom PHP Framework based on Symfony components.

I am using the following tutorial from Fabien Potencier's blog as a guide to implementing a framework on top of Symfony components:
http://fabien.potencier.org/article/50/create-your-own-framework-on-top-of-the-symfony2-components-part-1
My aim is to get a better understanding of how Symfony2 works, rather than just how to use it as a black-box framework.
